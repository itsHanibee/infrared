I always wanted to try Digital Infrared Photography, I'd seen alot of really beautiful and surreal looking images and videos over the years. \
The more I looked into trying it. The more I learnt how prohibitively expensive it could be, to get into, if you want to start doing this the old-school way with film.

I have to mention that you have to sacrifice a digital camera to do this. You have to remove its built-in IR Filter to convert it into a Full-Spectrum camera, this is objectively the right way to do this. \
[Kolari Vision](https://kolarivision.com) is one of the few companies that does such conversions on cameras. If you want to, you could get it done by a professional. And get a matching set of high-quality filters.

But, if you're doing it on your own, you have to start by removing the factory IR Filter on the camera, then replace it with a clear pane of glass. Enabling the sensor to access a much broader spectrum of light. Sensitive all the way from UV to the Visible spectrum and up to Infrared. \
Now all you need to do is limit what the sensor can see by placing an appropriate filter ahead of it.

While this is the best way to do an infrared conversion on a modern camera, it is hard to do and it does carry a risk of ruining your sensor permanently if your hands aren't very delicate. \
A cheap, low-tech solution for this could be to start off using post-processing on your images to achieve the typical infrared image look. \
But doing this does mean your image - while it looks like an infrared image, would nowhere be close to actually being one. You'd just be hue-shifting your colours to emulate a certain look.

This means you fail to capture a large amount of the essence for why infrared images look the way they do, the sensors capture real light and are influenced by physics and the environment they're capturing. And you notice the quality in the final output. \
The blinding overdose of reds being projected from the trees around in areas with dense foliage, they cast a red glow across your sensor from the reflected infrared. 
Such challenges make it quite hard to work with. And with actually finiky conditions, the challenge puts quite few amateur artist off but therein lies the charm of it, to capture a pretty image in lighting conditions that're constantly fighting you is what makes it special.

The most common type of images you would find when looking up an infrared images would be outdoor scenes with all the greenery turned into blood-red with perfect blue skies, and any water body turned into a bright teal. This is usually emulating the look of Kodak Autochrome films of late.

Or perhaps you find images of light pink vegetation and baby blue skies, a look that makes the world look like it's of candy floss. This is done by channel-inverting a 720nm filter.

This filter in its default state, with no processing produces very desaturated almost ghostly monochrome images. With barely blue vegetation and pale yellow skies.

Of course this is just the tip of the iceberg, when it comes to cool grading we can achieve with infrared. It's almost limitless
